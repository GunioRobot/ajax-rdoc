README for ajax-rdoc - the javascript enhanced rdoc template

The files included in this first release allow you to create a javascript enhanced rdoc (similar to what is on www.railsbrain.com right now).

Switch over to the directory where you want to run this rdoc template
rdoc --fmt ajax

Some shortcuts
=======
== Installation

1) Get the files 
		* tarball: http://github.com/breakpointer/ajax-rdoc/tarball/master)
		* git: git clone git://github.com/breakpointer/ajax-rdoc.git
		
2) cd into the new ajax-rdoc directory

3) Install the generator and templates into your version of rdoc
		* RDOC=/usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/rdoc rake install
		* If you are using macports ruby you can just rake install

4) Switch over to the directory where you want to run this rdoc template and run the following command
  	* rdoc --fmt ajax

5) This should start the generator and you'll have your new rdoc template in no-time! It should be in a folder called "doc"

alias jaxdoc="rdoc --fmt ajax --exclude .*generator.* --exclude .*test.* --exclude .*spec.*"

Alternatively you can set this env var and run the documentation generator from anyware (ie your home dir)

export RUBYLIB=~/brain/rails/src/jaxdoc_0.0.1 (for example)
