README for jaxdoc - the javascript enhanced rdoc template

The files included in this first release allow you to create a javascript enhanced rdoc (similar to what is on www.railsbrain.com right now).

To use these files you'll need to copy them to the rdoc folder in the directory for your local ruby install.

I only have tested this on a mac so the instructions are mac specific for now.

Your local rdoc (and ruby install) should be here... or something similar
/usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/rdoc

1) Unzip the jaxdoc package
2) Open the terminal (command line) and switch to the new jaxdoc dir that was created when you unzipped the package
3) copy the file 'ajax_generator.rb' to the 'generators' directory in your rdoc folder
  >sudo cp ajax_generator.rb /usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/rdoc/generators

4) copy the template files (and directory) over to the template directory inside the generators directory
  >sudo cp -R ajax /usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/rdoc/generators/template

5) Switch over to the directory where you want to run this rdoc template and use the -fmt command to run the this template
  >rdoc --fmt ajax

6) This should start the generator and you'll have your new rdoc template in no-time! It should be in a folder called "doc"

Should you have any problems (or questions) feel free to contact me at blchamberlain+rb@gmail.com

Thanks!

Alternatively you can set this env var and run the documentation generator from anyware (ie your home dir)

export RUBYLIB=~/brain/rails/src/jaxdoc_0.0.1 (for example)
